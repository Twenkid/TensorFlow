5.0 out of 5 stars Very reliable drives, highly recommended
Reviewed in Canada on November 9, 2018
Capacity : 10TBVerified Purchase
I've had very good luck with WD Red drives over the years in terms of reliability.

I've currently got 6 x 4TB (4 of which are in a RAID 5 array), 2 x 8TB, and 2 x 10TB. I've had a number of 2TB drives as well. All have performed very well.

- Very reliable drives
- Low power consumption
- Operates at low temperatures
- Quiet operation

Drive comparison:
10TB: 256MB cache, 210 MB/s sequential performance
*8TB: 128MB cache, 178 MB/s sequential performance
6TB: 64MB cache, 175 MB/s sequential performance
1-4TB: 64MB cache, ~150 MB/s sequential performance

*The 8TB sold here (model WD80EFZX) has a 128MB cache, but it's worth noting that there's other versions of this drive (models WD80EFAX and WD80EMAZ) which have a 256MB cache.

The 8TB/10TB models use a sealed helium chamber to reduce platter friction — HGST developed the technology for their expensive enterprise drives and WD acquired this technology when they purchased HGST. WD has now implemented it in the consumer space relatively unchanged but at roughly a fifth of the cost.

(I've had a number of Seagate drives in the past as well but I'll never buy another Seagate product as most of my Seagate drives failed rather miserably, including 2 in a RAID 5 array which failed almost simultaneously, resulting in the loss of a lot of important data. A couple of years ago Backblaze noted that their Seagate drives had a 73.5% survival rate over 36 months, with a burst of deaths near the 20 month mark. Their WD drives had a 94.8% survival rate over the same period — i.e. the WD drives were 5x less likely to fail within the first 3 years when compared to Seagate.)

***

My biggest gripe is actually unrelated to the product itself but with Amazon's limit of 1 drive per customer — this really makes no sense for NAS drives seeing as most people will need 2-4 of them. To use an audio analogy, this would be like having a limit of 1 speaker or 1 DJ turntable per customer... pretty silly.
(EDIT: I can confirm that you're able to reorder after exactly 7 days.)


!!!!! While not specific to this drive, I strongly recommend doing an 'Extended Scan' on all new HDDs you purchase to check for bad sectors before using them (whether WD, Seagate or otherwise.) It takes a bit of time but well worth it. If you find any bad sectors you can do an RMA before entrusting it with your data. For WD drives, you can use DLDIAG (Data Lifeguard Diagnostics) which you can download free from WD's website !!!!!

...

So well, after this big post all I need to know is if I should start the RMA process, and if yes, how much time do you think WD will take to deliver me a new disk? I live in Portugal.

 HDD Platter Database - Western Digital - 3.5" (RE/Gold/Se/Black/Red)

Here are all of the models currently in the database for this manufacturer and drive width. Models are sorted into sections by platter density.

Some tips:

    The total capacity of each individual model is shown beside each model number.

    A platter-head ratio is shown next to the total capacity tag in brackets. It works very simply: a (3/6) ratio indicates three disks and six read/write heads. Models that "waste" some amount of their actual total capacity in order to fit into certain capacity brackets (such as a 320GB unit based on one 500GB platter and two heads) are marked accordingly as [short-stroked].
	
Black (7200RPM, 128MB cache, SATA-600 interface, Advanced Format)

    WD4004FZWX-xxGBGBx 4TB (4/8)*

    WD5001FZWX-xxZHUAx/xxA2VAx 5TB (5/10)

    *Note: Rebadged HGST Ultrastar 7K6000 model, given the identical "US7SAK400" Type code on the label and obvious exterior similarities.



Red (5400RPM, 64MB cache, SATA-600 interface, Advanced Format)

    WD10EFRX-xxJCSNx/xxPJCNx/xxFYTNx 1TB (1/2)

    WD20EFRX-xxAX9Nx/xxEUZNx 2TB (2/4) OR (3/6 [667GB+/platter])*

    WD30EFRX-xxAX9Nx/xxEUZNx 3TB (3/6)

    WD40EFRX-xxWT0Nx 4TB (4/8)

    *Note: WD being annoying by introducing inferior drives into the market without changing the model code. Just like the new Seagate 2TB drives, be prepared to roll the dice if you purchase one of these online. You'll either get the slower three-platter variant (which weighs around 640 grams) or the "perfect" two-platter one, at least until WD gets its 1TB platter production up to spec.

If I bought one of the 2 TB version, how could I tell if it has 2 or 3 platters? Is there any software trick?

    None that I know of. Best way is to weigh the drive. Around 640 grams is three-platter, substantially lower is two-platter.

        My 2 TB WD20EFRX weighs 602 grams in the anti-static bag; salesman assured me it was 2 platters. Very fast compared with older WD 2TB drive; copying a 2GB file goes about twice as fast. Quiet drives, too.

        And it is still unknown if the selling drives atm are all three platters or not? I don't know if I should buy them with the risk of getting the inferior one.....

            Given that people are apparently receiving 3TB Greens with four platters in them (see comments in that section) instead of the ideal three, I wouldn't be surprised if WD are still distributing three-platter 2TB models.

            I personally have no recent experience with comparing drives at shops, though.

    fzabkar said:
    One would expect that a single platter design should be more reliable than two, but you are not comparing identical technologies. I would be asking whether the EFAX spins at 7200 RPM and whether this makes it inherently less reliable than a 5400 RPM model.

From WD's data sheet:

	EFAX 	EFRX
Weight	600g	450g
12VDC peak	1.31A	1.73A
Read/Write Power	4.1W	4.1W
Idle Power	2.3W	2.7W
Standby/Sleep Power	0.6W	0.4W
Idle acoustics	21dBA	23dBA
Seek acoustics	26dBA	24dBA
Max Xfer rate	180MB/s	147MB/s

I don't know what to make of these numbers. If the EFAX has fewer platters, why does it weigh more? But it seems to use less power overall. The idle is quieter, but the seek is noisier. It looks confusing and contradictory.

I found a review of a WD Blue laptop drive that uses SMR: https://www.newegg.com/Product/SingleProductReview?reviewid=5188127

    While [SMR] allows significantly higher capacities, it creates some complexity to writing. If the drive needs to write data in the middle of existing data, it can't just "place" it there like a HDD using PMR technology because other data also overlaps it. What it has to do is put the data in a temporary location, then re-write all the shingled data afterwards to the end of the track break.

    What does this mean for you? No change really in the way you use it. Just be aware that writes to the drive place the data in a temporary position, which is then relocated and shingled later on. The drive is smart enough to do this when you aren't busy, but this will make the drive sound like it's doing a lot of work even when the computer is idle. So if you hear the drive churning away while you are seemingly doing nothing - this is completely normal on any drive using SMR. The constant busy sound is not a defect, but rather a side effect - and it stops when the shingling is complete.

    If you use this as a main system drive, there are so many random writes with the paging files and temp files that it may never fully shingle the drive, making it sound as if it never stops working. For that reason, these are best used as storage drives that are read to often, but written to rarely. Don't even think about using an SMR drive in a RAID setup as you'll get very poor performance. 
	
	
	To me that would suggest reduced reliability simply because of all the extra work the drive has to do. The extra cache probably assists in the shingling process rather than improving performance. WD themselves aren't helping. They almost seem to be going out of their way to conceal the difference between the two versions.

Maybe the answer, then, is to get an older EFRX while I still can?
